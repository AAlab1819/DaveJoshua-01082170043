In one company, there are an employees. Among the employees they have a managers of the other employees. First we include the library, and then we go to the main using int main(). Then We declare the integer of employees, manager, depth, and to check, we use check.
now we include the parameters to make sure the program work properly, and then insert another parameters. After that we need to set the depth to 1, because all the things start from 1. wafter that inside for, we using while agaim to check if -1. and then just print out.

First we include the library and then get into the main. First we declare the int that we want to use and the string to play with the words. In this score, im using map, it will make this problem more easier. And then we use for for loop, we used this because we want to get the stores names and how many time, they have been used. And then, inside the for we used for again to prints name and number of times that already used to get the new name. And then print it ++ so the value wil +1.

In this case, we use tree to solve this problem. Now we using vectors. We will tranverse the tree top to down and check each element if the element is a leaf or 3 leaf. A leaf can be found if its vector is empty signifying that it has no child. If an element is not a leaf and has less than 3 leaf, then the tree is not a spruce, therefore ending the process. Otherwise the process will reach its end and the tree is therefore a spruce.
