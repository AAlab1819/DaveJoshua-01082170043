268B - Buttons:
First we need to use for user input, ->
----------------
a = int(input())
----------------

And then we set the value of the answer to 0 so it start from 0.
-------
ans = 0
-------

Now we need the paramater, and this case im using this so it will start from 1 to a+1.
And next to get the answer we need calculate using answer + answer * 1 (a-i), and then
answer + n. Then print it.
----------------------
for i in range(1,a+1):

598D - Igor In The Museum:
Igor is inside a n x m size museum.
He has a starting place (.) of x and y and will continue following the other. if possible
The problem is to solve how many pictures(*) he can see based on the direction left, righ, up, and down.

Example 1:

****
*..*
*.**
**.* 

if he's starting point = 3,2 and 4,3

****
*..*
*o**
**o*

at first there are 8 pictures he can see from the first starting point and 3 for the second point.
at this point we need to input the size of the museum = n x m, and k as the number of starting place.
Then input the same amount of * and . as the museum. And the postion of starting point. Now we using floodfill algorithm for each space on the museum to arrayIndexMap.
Then print out pictures he can see.
