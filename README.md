WEEK 1 SUBMISSION:

fraction:

in this case, we want to find 2 numbers that we add together is n. The numbers should also be coprime. n be ireducible proper fraction. To find the number, we check if the number gcd of the numbers is equal to 1(using the __ function). And if their sum is n from 1 to n/2 for the numerator and n to n/2 for the denominator. We then print out only the last pair of numbers from the loop.

alchemy:

to find the extra crystals that we need. We add the extra yellow and blue crystals that we need. To find the extra yellow crystals, we 
subtract the yellow crystals that we have by 2 times yellow balls & green balls. heres the simple math :

Yellow Crystal = Yellow Crystal we have - 2* Yellow Ball - Green Ball
Blue Crystal   = Blue Crystal - 3*Blue Ball - Green Ball


diverse team:

to see if it is possible to make a team of only distinct rating, we need to first find all the distinct numbers, and put them into a container, if the container size is smaller than the team size, it is not possible to make a team. If it is possible, we compare the elements in the new container with the original array for a match to find the index of the student and then print it out.
